# Numeric Matrix Processor
Numeric Matrix Processor project in Java. From JetBrains Academy (hyperskill.org).

### About
Learn to perform a variety of operations on matrices including addition, multiplication, finding the determinant, and
dealing with inverse matrices.

##### Stage 1: Addition
Write a program to read in two matrices and add them together. Input will be from standard input. The first line will be
the number of rows `n` and columns `m` in matrix `A` followed by `n` rows of `m` numbers. The next row has the rows and
columns of matrix `B` followed by its elements.

##### Stage 2: Multiplication by number
Modify the program to multiply a matrix by a specified constant. The first line from standard input will contain the
number of rows `n` and columns `m` of the matrix, followed by `n` rows of `m` numbers, followed on the last line by the
constant. Output the result of the multiplication to standard out.
