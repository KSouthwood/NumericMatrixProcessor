# Numeric Matrix Processor
Numeric Matrix Processor project in Java. From JetBrains Academy (hyperskill.org).

### About
Learn to perform a variety of operations on matrices including addition, multiplication, finding the determinant, and
dealing with inverse matrices.

##### Stage 1: Addition
Write a program to read in two matrices and add them together. Input will be from standard input. The first line will be
the number of rows `n` and columns `m` in matrix `A` followed by `n` rows of `m` numbers. The next row has the rows and
columns of matrix `B` followed by its elements.

##### Stage 2: Multiplication by number
Modify the program to multiply a matrix by a specified constant. The first line from standard input will contain the
number of rows `n` and columns `m` of the matrix, followed by `n` rows of `m` numbers, followed on the last line by the
constant. Output the result of the multiplication to standard out.

##### Stage 3: Matrix by matrix multiplication
Implement the ability to multiply one matrix by another matrix. Also, implement a menu system to choose which matrix
operation to be performed. Lastly, modify the program to be able to handle floating-point numbers.

##### Stage 4: Transpose
For this stage, time to code in matrix transposition. (Matrix transposition is an operation in linear algebra that
exchanges matrix rows on matrix columns and returns a new matrix as a result.) Although in math, the only transposition
is over the main diagonal (upper left to lower right), we'll code transpositions over both diagonals as well as
horizontally and vertically to flex our array skills.

##### Stage 5: Determined!
Implement methods to calculate the determinant of a matrix. A determinant is a single number that can be computed from
elements of a square matrix.

##### Stage 6: Inverse matrix
Find the inverse of a matrix. This will take a combination of the previous stages to complete.

The inverse of a matrix is a matrix that when multiplied with the original matrix yields an identity matrix.
